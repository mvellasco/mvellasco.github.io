MOV (in its lowercase form, `mov`) is one of the basic instructions any processor can understand, regardless of architecture. It is used to tell a processor to move data between registers. It also happens to be an acronym of my full name (**M**iguel **O**liveira **V**ellasco), which is why I chose it as the name of my website, due to my passion for computers and the coincidences of life (if these really exist, of course…).

I’m a -- not so -- humble Computer Programmer, born and raised in a small town located in the northwest of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. (I know it is spelled with a 'z' in English, but I cannot get used to it.) Currently, I live quite near it, in a bigger city called Campos dos Goytacazes (if there were translations for city names – which there aren’t – it would be something like “Goytacá Fields”). The city is named after an indigenous tribe called the Goytacá, which is famous for resisting an armed invasion longer than any other, never defeated in a fair fight, and never beaten (by invaders or other indigenous tribes) in the open and vast fields that comprised the city’s region. They faced their doom through contaminated – with smallpox – clothes left by the invaders, who, even using gunpowder, lost every battle against the strong bare-knuckle boxers who gave birth to this city.

I developed a taste for technology and computers very early in my life, so early that I can barely remember a moment when I wasn’t surrounded by a gadget or a computer. During these early days, I also developed a taste for “fixing” and “modifying” these gadgets, which would often result in completely breaking them.

These days, computers are still a very important part of my life, and I dedicate a significant amount of my time to making computers automate tasks and procedures of all sorts, so that people can be liberated from mundane tasks – such as filling spreadsheets to calculate business taxes, keeping company books up to date, or manually provisioning a bare-metal server half-way across the globe – and focus on living their lives.
