MOV(in its lowercase form `mov`) is one of the basic instructions any processor can understand, regardless of architecture. It is used to tell a processor to move data between registors. It also happens to be an achronim of my full name(**M**iguel **O**liveira **V**ellasco), which why I chose it to be the name of my website, due to my passion for computers and the coincidences of life(if these really exist of course...).

I'm a -- not so -- humble Computer Programmer, born and raised in a small town located in the northwest of the state of Rio de Janeiro - Brasil(I know it is spelled with a *z* in English, but I cannot get used to it). Currently living quite near it, in a bigger city though, called Campos dos Goytacazes(if there were translations for city names -- which there aren't -- it would be something like "Goytacá Fields"). The city is named after an indigenous tribe called Goytacá, which is famous for resisting an armed invasion longer than any other, never defeatten in a fair fight, as well as never beaten(by invaders or other indigenous tribes) in the open and vast fields that comprised the city's region. Facing their doom through contaminated -- with smallpox -- clothes left by the invaders, that even using gun-powder lost every battle against the strong bare-knuckle boxers who gave birth to this city.

I developed a taste for technology and computers very early on in my life, so early that I can barely remember a moment where I wasn't surrounded by a gadget or a computer. During these early days I also developed a taste for "fixing" and "modifying" these gadgets, which would result in completely breaking them of course.

These days computers are still a very important part of my life, and I dedicate a significant amount of my time to making computers automate tasks and procedures of all sorts, so that people can be liberated from mundane tasks -- such as filling spreadsheets to calculate business taxes, keep company books up to date, or manually provisioning a bare-metal server half-way across the globe -- and focus on living their lives.
